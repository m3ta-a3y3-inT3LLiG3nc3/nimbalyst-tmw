/**
 * Add-wins CRDT for tracker labels.
 *
 * `TrackerItemPayload.labels` is `Record<entryId, LabelEntry>` -- per-element
 * stable IDs let concurrent additions survive across peers (D3 of the
 * tracker-sync redesign). Removals tombstone the matching entries; on merge
 * a tombstone on one side wins over a live entry on the other side AT THE
 * SAME KEY. Different keys with the same `value` (two clients each adding
 * "bug") both survive -- that's the add-wins property.
 *
 * The on-screen value list is a projection of the map: unique `value`s
 * from non-tombstoned entries. The legacy `labels: string[]` API is kept;
 * callers diff-update against the prior map via `applyLabelDiff`.

 * string like `"[\"editor\", \"lexical\"]"` instead of a JSON array.
 * That broke the backfill path on every startup (`(newValues ?? []).filter

 * the candidate set on every reconnect.
 *

 * the labels CRDT. New writes go through the typed payload path and
 * produce `string[]`, so this is a one-way legacy compatibility shim.
