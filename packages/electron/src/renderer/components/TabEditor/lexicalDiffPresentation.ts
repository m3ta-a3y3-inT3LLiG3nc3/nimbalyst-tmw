/**
 * Whether a pending generation can afford an inline Lexical diff.
 *
 * The matcher aligns siblings with an O(m*n) cost matrix, so a document with
 * thousands of top-level blocks on each side blocks the renderer main thread for
 * tens of seconds and then dies on V8's Map size cap (#4821). Bytes are the
 * wrong proxy for that -- 194KB of prose is a handful of nodes, 194KB of bullets
 * is thousands -- so the byte check is only a cheap pre-filter and the real guard
 * counts root nodes after the baseline has been parsed.
 *
 * The decision lives here, away from the editor, because it is the half that can
 * be tested: both call sites in `TabEditor` do nothing but parse and then ask.
 * Declining inline rendering is a *presentation* outcome, never a resolution --
 * the caller must still put the agent's bytes in the buffer, keep the approval
 * bar and the pending tag, and report `presented-without-inline` (NIM-5359).
