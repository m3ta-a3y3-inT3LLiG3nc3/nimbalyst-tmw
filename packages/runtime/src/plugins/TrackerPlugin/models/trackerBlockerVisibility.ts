/**
 * How a readiness verdict is projected to a caller who cannot see every blocker.
 *
 * Readiness is computed over the FULL unfiltered corpus and must stay that way
 * -- deriving it after a caller's filters have run turns satisfied blockers into
 * dangling ids and reports blocked work as ready. But the explanation that
 * leaves the computation is a different question from the computation itself: a
 * caller asking for bugs should not be handed the title and private reference of
 * an archived plan it filtered out, and on the tool surface a blocker title is
 * attacker-influenced free text landing in an agent's context.
 *
 * So the verdict survives intact and the identifying detail does not. Both the
 * MCP projection and the grid chip call `projectBlockedBy`, because two copies
 * of this rule is how the surfaces come to disagree about what is safe to show.
