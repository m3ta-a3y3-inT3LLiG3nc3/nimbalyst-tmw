/**
 * The lifecycle transitions of a tracker and its items, as pure functions.
 *
 * Three transitions live here, and they are the invisible part of the sharing
 * model -- what a reader cannot see by looking at the screen:
 *
 *   - **Draft -> Published** (per item). A draft has NO issue key at all (D2);
 *     the room mints one at publication and it is never rewritten afterwards.
 *   - **Personal -> Team** (per tracker). One-way. Promotion publishes the
 *     existing items, which is when they receive their keys.
 *   - **Active -> Archived** (per tracker). Items are RETAINED and become
 *     read-only, so everything stays visible, searchable and keyed. Archiving
 *     is not deletion and is not a demotion back to personal.
 *
 * Pure and I/O-free on purpose: the Electron main process drives the writes,
 * the renderer draws the surfaces, and both agree on the rules stated here.
